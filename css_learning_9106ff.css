/*
  Learning Objective:
  This tutorial will teach you how to create a visually engaging button
  with a smooth, animated gradient background using CSS.
  We will focus on understanding and applying CSS properties like:
  - `background-image` for creating gradients.
  - `background-size` and `background-position` for animation control.
  - `transition` for smooth visual changes.
  - `animation` for creating looping or dynamic effects.
*/

/* --- Button Styling --- */

/*
  This class `animated-gradient-button` will be applied to our button element.
  It's designed to be flexible and can be added to any button tag (e.g., <button>, <a>).
*/
.animated-gradient-button {
  /*
    Basic button styling for good appearance and usability.
    `display: inline-block;` allows us to set width and height,
    while still allowing it to sit inline with text if needed.
  */
  display: inline-block;

  /*
    Padding adds space between the button text and its border,
    making the button easier to click and read.
    Top/bottom padding: 15px, Left/right padding: 30px.
  */
  padding: 15px 30px;

  /*
    Font styling for readability and aesthetics.
    `font-size`: Makes the text comfortably large.
    `font-weight: bold;`: Makes the text stand out.
    `color: white;`: Ensures text is visible against the gradient.
    `text-decoration: none;`: Removes default underline from anchor tags.
    `text-align: center;`: Centers the text within the button.
  */
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: white;
  text-decoration: none;
  text-align: center;

  /*
    Border radius rounds the corners of the button,
    giving it a softer, more modern look.
    A value of 50px creates a pill-shaped button if the height is sufficient.
  */
  border-radius: 50px;

  /*
    Cursor `pointer` changes the mouse cursor to a hand when hovering over the button,
    indicating it's clickable. This is a standard UI convention.
  */
  cursor: pointer;

  /*
    `overflow: hidden;` is crucial. When the background animation expands
    beyond the button's boundaries, `overflow: hidden` clips it,
    keeping the button's shape intact.
  */
  overflow: hidden;

  /*
    `position: relative;` is often used in conjunction with pseudo-elements
    (like ::before or ::after) to position them relative to the button itself.
    While not strictly necessary for *this* animation, it's a common pattern
    for more complex button effects.
  */
  position: relative;

  /*
    `border: none;` removes any default border that browsers might apply to buttons.
    We're relying solely on the gradient for visual definition.
  */
  border: none;

  /*
    `outline: none;` removes the outline that appears around a button when it
    receives focus (e.g., when clicked or navigated to with a keyboard).
    This is for aesthetic control, but ensure you have alternative focus indicators
    for accessibility (e.g., a subtle box-shadow on `:focus`).
  */
  outline: none;

  /*
    `transition` creates smooth visual changes when properties change.
    Here, we're telling the browser to smoothly transition any changes to
    `background-position` over 2 seconds. This makes the animation feel fluid.
    `ease-in-out` is a timing function that starts slowly, speeds up, and ends slowly.
  */
  transition: background-position 2s ease-in-out;

  /*
    --- Gradient Background ---
    This is the core of our visual effect.
    `background-image`: Defines the gradient.
    `linear-gradient()`: Creates a gradient that transitions linearly.
    `45deg`: Sets the angle of the gradient.
    `#ff9a9e`, `#fecfef`, `#a18cd1`, `#fbc2eb`: These are color stops.
    The gradient will smoothly blend between these colors along the 45-degree line.
  */
  background-image: linear-gradient(45deg, #ff9a9e 0%, #fecfef 50%, #a18cd1 75%, #fbc2eb 100%);

  /*
    `background-size`: Controls the size of the background image relative to the element.
    `400% 400%`: This makes the background gradient much larger than the button itself.
    Imagine a large canvas of the gradient and we're only showing a small window (the button).
    This large size is essential for the `background-position` animation to have room to move.
  */
  background-size: 400% 400%;

  /*
    --- Hover Effect ---
    When the user hovers over the button, we want a visual change.
    `:hover` is a pseudo-class that applies styles when the mouse is over the element.
  */
  &:hover {
    /*
      `background-position`: We shift the `background-position` to the right and down.
      Because the `background-size` is 400% x 400%, moving the position
      reveals different parts of the large gradient image, creating the animation.
      `100% 100%` means shift the origin of the background image to the bottom-right corner
      of the button's area. The `transition` property defined earlier ensures this change is smooth.
    */
    background-position: 100% 100%;
  }

  /*
    --- Optional: Active/Pressed State ---
    This provides feedback when the button is actually clicked.
    `:active` is a pseudo-class that applies styles when the element is being activated (e.g., clicked).
  */
  &:active {
    /*
      You could add a subtle change here, like a slight shift in background position
      or a change in shadow, to indicate the button is being pressed.
      For simplicity, we'll keep it similar to hover but you can customize this.
      This example just slightly shifts the position again.
    */
    background-position: 0% 0%; /* Reset or shift differently */
    /* A subtle scale down can also work well */
    /* transform: scale(0.98); */
  }

  /*
    --- Accessibility Consideration (Focus State) ---
    When a button is focused (e.g., via keyboard navigation), it's important
    to provide a visual indicator. This is critical for accessibility.
    We'll add a subtle `box-shadow` for this.
  */
  &:focus {
    /*
      `box-shadow`: Adds a shadow around the button.
      `0 0 0 3px rgba(255, 154, 158, 0.5)`:
        - `0 0`: No offset for the shadow.
        - `0 3px`: A blur radius of 3 pixels.
        - `rgba(255, 154, 158, 0.5)`: A semi-transparent red shadow,
          chosen to complement the gradient. The `0.5` makes it 50% opaque.
      This creates a glowing effect when the button is focused.
    */
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(255, 154, 158, 0.5);
  }
}

/* --- Example Usage --- */

/*
  To use this button, simply add the class `animated-gradient-button`
  to any HTML element you want to style as a button.
  Commonly, you'll use the <button> tag or an <a> tag styled as a button.
*/

/*
  Example 1: A standard <button> element.
  <button class="animated-gradient-button">Click Me!</button>
*/

/*
  Example 2: An <a> (anchor) tag styled as a button.
  This is useful for navigation links that should look like buttons.
  <a href="#" class="animated-gradient-button">Learn More</a>
*/

/*
  You can also apply this class to other elements if needed,
  though <button> and <a> are the most semantic and recommended.
*/

/*
  Let's create a couple of example buttons in HTML for you to see this in action.
  You would typically place these within the <body> tag of your HTML file.
*/

/*
  <button class="animated-gradient-button">Submit Form</button>
  <a href="#" class="animated-gradient-button">Visit Our Site</a>
*/

/*
  Experiment with different color stops in the `linear-gradient()` function
  to create your own unique color themes.
  Try changing the `45deg` angle to other values like `90deg` or `135deg`.
  Adjust the `transition` duration to make the animation faster or slower.
  You can also modify the `background-position` values in the `:hover` state.
