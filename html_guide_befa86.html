<!--
LEARNING OBJECTIVE:
Understand and apply advanced semantic HTML5 tags to structure a rich blog post or news article for enhanced accessibility and SEO.
This tutorial focuses on using tags like <article>, <header>, <time>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <blockquote>, <aside>, <section>, and <footer>
to clearly define content sections and improve document outline, making web content more meaningful to browsers, search engines, and assistive technologies.
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be an HTML5 document.
     WHY: It tells the browser which HTML standard to use, enabling modern features and consistent rendering. -->

<html lang="en">
<!-- The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page. All other elements are descendants of it.
     The 'lang' attribute specifies the primary language of the document (e.g., "en" for English).
     WHY: Crucial for accessibility (screen readers pronounce text correctly) and SEO (search engines serve language-specific content). -->

<head>
    <!-- The <head> element contains meta-information about the HTML document that is not displayed directly on the page. -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- <meta charset="UTF-8"> specifies the character encoding for the document.
         WHY: Ensures proper display of various international characters and prevents display issues. -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- <meta name="viewport"> configures the viewport's width and initial zoom level.
         WHY: Essential for responsive web design, ensuring your content adapts well to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). -->
    <title>Semantic Article Structure Tutorial</title>
    <!-- The <title> element sets the title that appears in the browser tab or window title bar.
         WHY: A critical SEO factor (often displayed in search results) and important for user orientation. -->
</head>

<body>
    <!-- The <body> element contains all the visible content of an HTML document. -->

    <main>
        <!-- The <main> element represents the dominant content of the <body> of a document.
             There should only be one <main> element per document, and it should NOT be a descendant of <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <header>, or <nav>.
             WHY: It's crucial for accessibility, allowing screen readers and other assistive technologies to skip directly to the main content.
             It clearly signals the primary focus of the page. -->

        <article>
            <!-- The <article> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site,
                 which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry).
                 Think of it as a complete piece of content that could be syndicated elsewhere without losing its meaning.
                 WHY: It tells search engines and screen readers that this block of content is a complete, standalone piece.
                 Helps in content syndication and enhances the document outline. -->

            <header>
                <!-- The <header> element, when used INSIDE an <article>, represents the introductory content for THAT SPECIFIC article.
                     It typically contains the article's heading, author information, and publication date.
                     WHY: Semantically groups the introductory information specific to the article, improving clarity and machine understanding. -->
                <h1>The Wonders of Semantic HTML5: Structuring Your Content</h1>
                <!-- <h1> is the main heading for THIS article. There should generally be only one <h1> per <article> to define its primary topic.
                     WHY: Essential for SEO, defining the most important keyword/topic of the article. Aids accessibility by giving a clear starting point. -->

                <!-- <p> for introductory text like author and date.
                     The <time> element represents a specific period in time (e.g., a date, time, or duration).
                     The 'datetime' attribute provides a machine-readable format (YYYY-MM-DD), crucial for SEO, calendar apps, and data extraction.
                     WHY: Semantic meaning for dates/times, improving discoverability and clarity for machines. -->
            </header>

            <p>Semantic HTML5 tags go beyond mere styling. They provide meaning to the content, making web pages more accessible,
               search engine friendly, and easier to maintain. Let's explore some key elements for structuring a rich post.</p>

            <h2>Why Semantics Matter for Blog Posts</h2>
            <!-- <h2> represents a subheading within the article, nested logically under <h1>.
                 Subheadings (h2, h3, etc.) create a hierarchical structure.
                 WHY: Creates a clear content hierarchy, aiding both readability for users and understanding for search engines/screen readers.
                 Helps users quickly scan content and allows search engines to better index topic sections. -->
            <p>Using semantic tags helps browsers, search engines, and other web technologies understand the content better.
               Instead of just generic `div` tags, we use tags that describe the *type* of content they contain, like an `<article>` or a `<blockquote>`.</p>

            <figure>
                <!-- The <figure> element is used to encapsulate media content (like images, diagrams, code snippets, videos, etc.)
                     that is referenced from the main flow of the document, but that can be moved to another part of the document
                     or to an appendix without affecting the main flow.
                     WHY: Semantically groups media with its caption, improving content structure and making it clear what the image is about. -->
                <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x300/F0F0F0/000000?text=Semantic+HTML+Structure" alt="Diagram showing semantic HTML elements like header, article, aside, and footer">
                <!-- <img> displays an image. The 'src' defines the image source.
                     The 'alt' attribute is vital for accessibility (screen readers describe the image content) and SEO (image search). -->
                <figcaption>
                    <!-- The <figcaption> element provides a caption or legend for the content of its parent <figure>.
                         WHY: Explicitly associates a caption with its figure, enhancing accessibility and context for both users and machines. -->

            <h3>Benefits for Accessibility and SEO</h3>
            <!-- <h3> is a subheading nested under <h2>, further refining the content structure. -->
            <p>For users relying on screen readers, semantic HTML provides a navigational roadmap. Tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`,
               `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>` allow screen readers to announce the type of content and enable users
               to skip to relevant sections quickly. For SEO, well-structured content is easier for crawlers to understand and index.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <!-- The <blockquote> element indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation.
                     It typically renders with an indent. For short inline quotes, use <q>.
                     WHY: Semantically identifies quoted content, aiding understanding for machines and users. -->

                <footer>— <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite></footer>
                <!-- The <footer> element, when used within a <blockquote>, provides attribution for the quote. -->
            </blockquote>

            <aside>
                <!-- The <aside> element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content.
                     It is often presented as a sidebar, a call-out box, or a complementary section within the article.
                     WHY: Clearly separates tangential content (like an author bio, related links, or advertisements) from the main flow,
                     improving readability and semantic clarity for both users and search engines. -->

            <section>
                <!-- The <section> element represents a standalone section of a document, typically with a heading.
                     It's more generic than <article> and useful for grouping related thematic content within an article,
                     like "Related Posts" or "Comments" if they were part of the article's main content.
                     WHY: Helps organize content into logical thematic groups, enhancing the document's structure. -->

            <footer>
                <!-- The <footer> element, when used INSIDE an <article>, represents the footer for THAT SPECIFIC article.
                     It can contain information like tags, categories, related articles, author contact info, or copyright specific to the article.
                     WHY: Semantically groups the concluding information specific to the article, signaling its end. -->

        </article>
        <!-- End of <article> -->

    </main>
    <!-- End of <main> -->

    <!--
        NOTE: This tutorial focuses on the <article> structure.
        In a full webpage, you'd typically have a global <nav> (navigation) and a global <footer> (site-wide footer)
        outside of the <main> element, defining the overall site structure.
        Here's a minimal example for context:
    -->
    <nav>
        <!-- The global <nav> element represents a section of a page that contains navigation links to other pages or to parts within the page.
             WHY: Clearly defines navigation for users and search engines. -->
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="/blog">All Blog Posts</a></li>
            <li><a href="/about">About Us</a></li>
            <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

    <footer class="site-footer">
        <!-- The global <footer> element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content (often the <body> itself).
             A global footer typically contains information about the entire website, like copyright data,
             links to privacy policy, or social media links.
             WHY: Semantically identifies the site-wide footer, distinct from an article-specific footer. -->
